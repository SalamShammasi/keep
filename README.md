## 🗼 A glance of Keep

Keep is a simple CLI tool that contains everything you need to start creating Alerts.

-   10s of providers ready to use with your own data
-   Simple CLI tool to configure, trigger and test your alerts
-   Easily deployable via docker, vercel, github actions, etc.
-   Alerts are managed by simple yaml files that are human-readable

Brought to you by developers, EASY to use and managable by code.

## 🚨 Providers

[Providers](https://keephq.wiki/providers/what-is-a-provider) are Keep's way of interacting with 3rd party products; Keep uses them either to query data or to send notifications.

We tried our best to cover all common providers, [missing any?](https://github.com/keephq/keep/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature,provider&template=feature_request.md&title=Missing%20PROVIDER_NAME), providers include:

-   **Cloud**: AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.
-   **Monitoring**: Sentry, New Relic, Datadog, etc.
-   **Incident Management**: PagerDuty, OpsGenie, etc.
-   **Communication**: Email, Slack, Console, etc.
-   [and more...](https://github.com/keephq/keep/tree/main/keep/providers)

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Run locally
Try our first mock alert and get it up and running in <5 minutes - Ready? Let's Go! ⏰

<h5>First, clone Keep repository:</h5>

```shell
git clone https://github.com/keephq/keep.git && cd keep
```

<h5>Install Keep CLI</h5>

```shell
pip install .

```
keep config provider --provider-type slack --provider-id slack-demo
```
