#### üö® What is an alert?
An alert is a human-readable notification that informs about the status of a service or a component. Alerts are sent, based on their urgency, to ticketing platforms, queues or directly to the owners of the components being affected.

Having a structured alerting policy in your enviroment is pivotal to gain better visibility of the monitored components and reduce MTTD (Mean Time To Detect) of issues that could undermine the functionality of your system.

#### üöÄ Quickstart
Keep has two main component that play with each other:
1. [Keep UI](https://www.keephq.wiki/platform/ui/getting-started) - UI to manage your alerts, connect providers and install apps.
2. [Keep Core](https://www.keephq.wiki/platform/getting-started) - The engine behind Keep.
#### Keep UI
The easiest way to start with Keep is to run it via docker-compose:
```shell
wget -O docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keephq/keep/main/docker-compose.yml
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```
Keep UI is now available at http://localhost:3000

#### Keep Core
Try our first mock alert and get it up and running in <5 minutes - Ready? Let's Go! ‚è∞

First, clone Keep repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/keephq/keep.git && cd keep
```

Install Keep CLI

```shell
pip install .
```

or

```shell
poetry shell
poetry install
```

From now on, Keep should be installed locally and accessible from your CLI, test it by executing:


```
keep version
```

<h5>Get a Slack incoming webhook using <a href="https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks">this tutorial</a> and use Keep to configure it:</h5>

```
keep config provider --provider-type slack --provider-id slack-demo
```

Paste the Slack Incoming Webhook URL (e.g. <https://hooks.slack.com/services/...>) and you're good to go üëå

<h6>** If you don't want to create your own webhook, you can follow these easy 3 steps: **

1. Go to [keep's slack](https://keephq.dev/slack).

2. Enter the #alerts-playground channel.

3. In the channel's topic, you can find the webhook provided by Keep.

<h5>Let's now execute our example "Paper DB has insufficient disk space" alert</h5>

```bash
keep run --alerts-file examples/alerts/db_disk_space.yml
```

    <img src="/assets/alert-example.png">
    <br />
    You should have received your first "Dunder Mifflin Paper Company" alert in Slack by now.
    <br />
</div>


##### Docker

Configure the Slack provider (See "[Run locally](https://github.com/keephq/keep#from-now-on-keep-should-be-installed-locally-and-accessible-from-your-cli-test-it-by-executing)" on how to obtain the webhook URL)

```bash
docker run -v ${PWD}:/app -it us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/keephq/keep/keep-cli config provider --provider-type slack --provider-id slack-demo
```

You should now have a providers.yaml file created locally

Run Keep and execute our example "Paper DB has insufficient disk space" alert

```bash
docker run -v ${PWD}:/app -it us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/keephq/keep/keep-cli -j run --alert-url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keephq/keep/main/examples/alerts/db_disk_space.yml
```

##### Render
Click the Deploy to Render button to deploy Keep as a background worker running in [Render](https://www.render.com)

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/keephq/keep)

To run Keep and execute our example "Paper DB has insufficient disk space" alert, you will need to configure you Slack provider.
<br />
When clicking the Deploy to Render button, you will be asked to provide the `KEEP_PROVIDER_SLACK_DEMO` environment variable, this is the expected format:

```json
{"authentication": {"webhook_url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."}}
```

\* Refer to [Run locally](https://github.com/keephq/keep/tree/feature/api-multi-tenant#get-a-slack-incoming-webhook-using-this-tutorial-and-use-keep-to-configure-it) on how to obtain the webhook URL
