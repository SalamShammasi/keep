Keep CLI allow you to control Keep from CLI. The main purpose behind the CLI was to be able to run workflows from the CLI.

Start by [installing](/cli/installation) Keep CLI and [running a workflow](/cli/commands/cli-run).

<Info>Keep API is not fully covered by the CLI. If you need an API to be support via the CLI, open an issue and we will get to it as soon as possible.</Info>
