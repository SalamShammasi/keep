## Basic Authentication

For single-tenant applications requiring user management and authentication, Keep supports basic authentication with username and password.

### When to Use

- **Self-Hosted Deployments:** When you're deploying Keep for individual use or within an organization without the need for multi-tenancy.
- **Enhanced Security:** Provides a simple yet effective layer of security for your Keep instance.

### Setup Instructions

Use the `docker-compose-with-auth.yml` for an easy setup, which includes necessary environment variables for enabling basic authentication:

```yml
# Backend configuration
- AUTH_TYPE=SINGLE_TENANT
- KEEP_JWT_SECRET=keepjwtsecret # Replace with a secure secret
- KEEP_DEFAULT_USERNAME=admin # Replace as needed
- KEEP_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=keep # Replace with a secure password

# Frontend configuration
- AUTH_TYPE=SINGLE_TENANT
