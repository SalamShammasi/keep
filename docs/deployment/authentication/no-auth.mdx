title: "No Authentication"
---

Deploying Keep without authentication is the quickest way to get up and running, ideal for local development or internal tools where security is not a concern.
## Setup Instructions
Either if you use docker-compose, kubernetes, openshift or any other deployment method, add the following environment variable:
```
# This should be available both for the API and the UI
AUTH_TYPE=NO_AUTH
```
## Implications
With `AUTH_TYPE=NO_AUTH` - Keep won't show any login page and will let you consume API's without authentication.
