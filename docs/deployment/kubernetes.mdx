Keep can be installed via Helm Chart.

First, clone Keep:
```
git clone https://github.com/keephq/keep.git && cd keep
```

Next, install using:
```
helm install -f chart/keep/values.yaml keep chart/keep/
```

Notice for it to work locally, you'll need this port forwarding:
```
kubectl port-forward svc/keep-frontend 3000:3000
```
