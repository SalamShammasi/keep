# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Quickstart

## Run Locally

### Docker-compose (Option 1)

Run *Keep* full stack (Console & API)
```bash
docker-compose up
```
Or
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```
If you want to run *Keep* in [development mode](https://development-mode-url) (code compiles on changes)

:::note OpenAI Integration
Please note that some features used by Keep requires OpenAI API key to work.
Export `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-YOUR_API_KEY` before running docker-compose to make them available.

For example:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-YOUR_API_KEY docker-compose up
```

### Clone and install (Option 2)
Try our first mock alert and get it up and running in <5 minutes - Ready? Let's Go! ‚è∞

<h5>First, clone Keep repository:</h5>

```shell
git clone https://github.com/keephq/keep.git && cd keep
```

<h5>Install Keep CLI</h5>

```shell
pip install .
```
or
```shell
poetry install
```

<h5>From now on, Keep should be installed locally and accessible from your CLI, test it by executing:</h5>

```
keep version
```

<h5>Get a Slack Incoming Webhook using [this tutorial](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) and use use Keep to configure it</h5>

```
keep config provider --provider-type slack --provider-id slack-demo
```
Paste the Slack Incoming Webhook URL (e.g. https://hooks.slack.com/services/...) and you're good to go üëå

<h5>Let's now execute our example "Paper DB has insufficient disk space" alert</h5>

```bash
keep run --alerts-file examples/alerts/db_disk_space.yml
```

<h5>Congrats ü•≥ You should have received your first "Dunder Mifflin Paper Company" alert in Slack by now.</h5>

Wanna have your alerts up and running in production? Go through our more detailed [Deployment Guide](https://keephq.wiki/deployment).

## Enable Auto Completion

<h4>Keep's CLI supports shell auto-completion, which can make your life a whole lot easier üòå</h4>

If you're using zsh
```shell title=~/.zshrc
eval "$(_KEEP_COMPLETE=zsh_source keep)"
```


If you're using bash
```bash title=~/.bashrc
eval "$(_KEEP_COMPLETE=bash_source keep)"
```


> Using eval means that the command is invoked and evaluated every time a shell is started, which can delay shell responsiveness. To speed it up, write the generated script to a file, then source that.
