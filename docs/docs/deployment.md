# Deployment

## 👷🏻‍♀️ Under Construction

```diff
- We are currently working on a Dockerfile and various "Click-to-deploy" buttons, coming soon!
```

Currently, Keep only works as a command-line interface (CLI).
In a real-world production scenario where on-going monitoring is required, Keep needs to be deployed as a daemon.
This can be achieved in various ways such as cron, serverless computing platforms (e.g. Vercel, fly.io, Render, Cloud Run, ECS, etc.), or dedicated servers.

#### Want to deploy Keep on a specific platform? [Just open an issue](https://github.com/keephq/keep/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=feature:%20new%20deployment%20option) and we will get to it ASAP!
