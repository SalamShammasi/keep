# Deployment


#### 👷🏻‍♀️ Under construction 👷🏻‍♀️
At present, Keep only exists as a command-line interface (CLI). However, in a real-world production scenario where ongoing monitoring is required, Keep needs to be deployed in an automated manner. This can be achieved using tools such as Cron, serverless computing platforms, or dedicated servers.

#### Want to deploy Keep on specific platform? [Just open an issue](https://github.com/keephq/keep/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=feature:%20new%20deployment%20option) and we wil get to it ASAP!
