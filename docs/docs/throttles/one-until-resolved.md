  description: Check that the service is up
  steps:
    - name: service-is-up

        type: python
        with:
          # any external libraries needed
          imports: requests
          code: requests.get("http://localhost:3000")
      condition:
        - type: assert
          assert: "{{ steps.this.results.status_code }} == 200"
