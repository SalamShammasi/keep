## Keep vs Alerta
> alerta monitoring system is a tool used to consolidate and de-duplicate alerts from multiple sources for quick ‘at-a-glance’ visualisation. With just one system you can monitor alerts from many other monitoring tools on a single screen

## Keep vs Grafana

> Using Grafana Alerting, you create queries and expressions from multiple data sources — no matter where your data is stored — giving you the flexibility to combine your data and alert on your metrics and logs in new and unique ways. You can then create, manage, and take action on your alerts from a single, consolidated view, and improve your team’s ability to identify and resolve issues quickly.

## Keep vs observability tools (Datadog, New Relic, etc)
Any of the existing observability tools implements alerting mechanism. However, they have two disadvanteges:
- They are data centric - which means your data needs to be in the tool in order to be able to alert on it.
- Alerts are third-class citizen - its easy to set up some basic alerts, but its hard to create a great alert culture.

> If you are not suffering from the problems above or the [problems Keep solves](overview/) and satisfied with your alerting, you probably don't need Keep

Keep mitigates these concerns by being agnostic to where the data is, so you can alert on whatever you want, and treats alerts as first-class citizen which let you create a great alerting culture.



## Keep vs incident management tools (PagerDuty, OpsGenie, etc)
Most of the incident management tools offers alert aggregation and workflow automation. However, their core value is the incident management itself, which Keep aim to prevent. Keep focuses only on the alert lifecycle.
