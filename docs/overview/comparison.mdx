title: "Comparison"
---

Sometimes, it's easier to understand a tool's capabilities by comparing it to other tools in the same ecosystem. In this section, we'll discuss how Keep interacts with and compares to other tools in the ecosystem.

## Keep vs IRM (PagerDuty, OpsGenie, etc.)

Incident management tools aim to "notify the right person at the right time," facilitate reporting, and create effective war rooms. 

"Keep" focus on the alert lifecycle, noise reduction, and AI-driven alert-incident correlation. Essentially, Keep serves as an 'intelligent layer before the IRM,' handling millions of alerts before they get fed into your IRM tool. Keep provides high-quality integrations with PagerDuty, OpsGenie, Grafana OnCall, and others.

## Keep vs AIOps in Observability (Elastic, Splunk, etc.)

Keep differs because it's able to correlate alerts between different observability platforms.

## Keep vs AIOps platforms (BigPanda, Moogsoft, etc.)

Keep is an alternative to platforms like BigPanda and Moogsoft. 
We differ with many things but farmost by being open source, which makes integration and piloting easy. Customers who tried both traditional platforms and Keep note a significant difference in the alert correlation approach since Keep is a lot less manual and uses state-of-the-art AI models, meaning it's easier for Keep to correlate alerts, which never happened before.
