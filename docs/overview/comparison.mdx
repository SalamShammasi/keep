title: "Comparison"
---

Sometimes, it's easier to understand a tool's capabilities by comparing it to other tools in the same ecosystem. In this section, we'll discuss how Keep interacts with and compares to other tools in the ecosystem.

## Keep vs observability traditional AIOps

Keep differs because it's able to correlate alerts between different observability platforms.

## Keep vs traditional AIOps platforms

BigPanda and Moogsoft are our direct competitors. Keep differs because it's open source, which makes integration and piloting easy. Our customer also noticed a significant difference in the alert correlation approach since we at Keep focus less on manual configuration and more on applying state-of-the-art AI models, meaning it's easier for Keep to correlate alerts, which never happened before.

## Keep vs IRM (PagerDuty, OpsGenie, etc.)

Incident management tools aim to "notify the right person at the right time," facilitate reporting, and create effective war rooms. 

"Keep" focus on the alert lifecycle, noise reduction, and AI-driven alert-incident correlation. Essentially, Keep serves as an 'intelligent layer before the IRM,' handling millions of alerts before they get fed into your IRM tool. Keep provides high-quality integrations with PagerDuty, OpsGenie, Grafana OnCall, and others.
