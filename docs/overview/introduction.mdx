You can start working with Keep by login to the [platform](https://platform.keephq.dev).
## What's alert?

Alert is an event that triggered when something bad happens or going to happen.
It usually triggered by tools such as Promethues, Grafana or Cloudwatch and, in some cases, propiteray tools.


Alerts can be categorized into three different groups:
- Infrastructure related alerts - e.g. some VM consume more than 99% CPU.
- Application related alerts - e.g. some endpoint starts to return 5XX.
- Buisness related alerts - e.g. a drop in the number of signin's or purchases.

## What problem does Keep solve?
Keep helps with every step of the alert lifecycle:
1. Creation - Keep provides a framework to create, debug and test [alerts as code](overview/keyconcepts#alertsascode) that scale with your teams.
2. Maintenance - Keep integrates with your existing tools and let you maintain all of your alerts withing a [single pane of glass](overview/keyconcepts#singlepaneofglass).
3. Noise reduction - by integrating with your alerts-triggering tools, Keep can deduplicates and correlate alerts to reduce the noise in your organization.
4. Automation - [Keep Workflows](overview/keyconcepts#workflows) let you automate [alert enrichment](overview/keyconcepts#enrichment) and [response](overview/keyconcepts#reponse).

## How does Keep integrate with the alerts?
Alerts can be either [pulled](overview/keyconcepts#pullingalerts) by Keep or [pushed](overview/keyconcepts#pullingalerts) into Keep. Keep also offers a zero-click alerts onboarding with [webhook instllation](overview/keyconcepts).
