## Alert
Alert is an event that triggered when something bad happens or going to happen.
The term alert sometime can be replaced with "alarm" (Cloudwatch) or "monitor" (Datadog).

You can easily trigger a [Workflow](#workflow) when an alert triggers.

## Provider
Provider is the input/output building block in Keep.

When you connect a Provider, Keep starts to read the alerts from the Provider and process it. For example, after connecting your Promethues, you'll start see your Promethues alerts in Keep.


In a Workflow context, Provider also:
- Query data - queries Datadog's API or runs a SQL query against a database.
- Push data - sends a Slack message or create a PagerDuty incident.

To learn more about what's a Provider, visit the [Provider](provider/) page.

## Workflow
Workflows are list of [Steps](#steps) and [Actions](overview/keyconcepts#actions).
The entry point of a workflow can be either:
- When Alert is triggered.
- In a predefined interval.
- Manually.

Workflows are being used to:
1. Add more context to your alerts.
2. Automate the response to alert.
3. Create multi-steps alerts.

## API first
Keep is an API-first, and as such, each of the things that you can do in the [UI](ui/) can be done via the [API](api/)
This give you the power to integrate Keep with your existing stack and automate the alert remediation and enrichment process.
