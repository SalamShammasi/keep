## Central Alerts management
No more navigating between your Promethues'es instances, no more per-region per-account Cloudwatch. By connecting your alert-triggering tools, you get a single pane of glass for all of your alerts.
With Keep, you can review, throttle, mute and fine tune all of your alerts within a one console.

## Alerts enrichment
You are no more limited by the alert mechanism that your tools implements.

You want the alert to trigger only on your enterprise customers? No problem.
You want to add more context that doesn't live in your tool? Easy.

Just connect your observability tools, databases, ticketing systems, or any other tool which might add context, and integrate them with your alerts.


## Automate the alert response process
"If you can automate the response for alert, it shouldn't be an alert", right?
Maybe in an optimal world. In fact, we know that most of the times alert response can be automated - either by "double checking" or adding steps that will verify the alert is not false positive.

Imagine a common use case - you get an 502 in one of your endpoints. You need an alert for it, don't you?
But what if you could verify that its a real error by another query? Or even checking if its an free trial user which can wait for the morning?
