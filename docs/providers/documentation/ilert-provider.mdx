## Connecting with the Provider

### API Token

To obtain the ILert API token, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your ILert account.
2. Navigate to the "API Tokens" section under your user profile or account settings.
3. Generate a new API token.
4. Make sure "Read Permission" and "Write Permission" are checked.
