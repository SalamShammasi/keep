  Please note that when installing SignalFX with Webhook auto instrumentation,
  Keep installs itself as a Webhook Integration, adds itself as a subscriber to all available
  SignalFX Detector and Rules.

  When a new Detector created, you'll need to add Keep as a subscriber or re-run the "setup webhook"
  from the UI

For more information, feel free to reach out on our Slack Community.

## Overview

## Connecting with the Provider
There are three approaches to connect with SignalFX:
- Push (manually) - Install Keep as a Webhook Integration.
- Push (auto instrumentation) - Let Keep instrument itself as webhook integration and subscribe to your SignalFx detectors.
- Pull - Keep will pull alerts from SignalFx.

<Tip>The recommened way to install SignalFx is Push with auth instrumentation. With this approach, you have the advantages of Push approach which are - more context (since SignalFx sends more context on Webhooks) and more real time, with the convient of Pull integration (just supply credentials and Keep will do the rest)</Tip>
In the following sections we will elaborate on each approach.

### Push (manually)
<Info>For more information about how SignalFx integrates with Webhooks, you can read https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/admin/notif-services/webhook.html#webhook2</Info>
1. From your SignalFx console, click on "Data Management":

</Frame>

2. Click on "+ Add Integration"

<Frame
    width="100"
    height="200">
    <img height="10" src="/images/signalfx_manual_2.png" />
</Frame>

3. Change the "By Use Case" select to "All" and filter "webhook":

    height="200">
    <img height="10" src="/images/signalfx_manual_3.png" />
</Frame>

4. Click on the Webhook tile and fill the following details:


<Frame

    height="200">
    <img height="10" src="/images/signalfx_manual_4.png" />
</Frame>

5. Now, go to Detectors & SLOs page:


<Frame
    width="100"
    height="200">
    <img height="10" src="/images/signalfx_manual_5.png" />
</Frame>

6. For every Detector and Rule, add Keep as Alert recipient:

    height="200">
    <img height="10" src="/images/signalfx_manual_6.png" />
</Frame>





### Push (auto instrumentation)
With this approach:
1. Keep will install itself as Webhook Integration.
2. Keep will iterate all Detectors and Rules, and will add itself as a subscriber

<Info>The downside of this approach is that you'll need email/password of a user with admin role. This is due to SignalFx limitation on installing integrations: You can read more here - https://dev.splunk.com/observability/reference/api/integrations/latest#endpoint-create-integration </Info>

</Frame>


To install Keep with Push (auto instrumentation):
1. SF token with read permissions - go to Settings -> Access Tokens -> New Token

<Frame
    width="100"
    height="200">
    <img height="10" src="/images/signalfx_accesstoken.png" />
</Frame>

2. email/password for a user with admin role - this will be used only for creating the Webhook Integration
3. orgid - this will be used only for creating the Webhook Integration

<Frame
    width="100"
    height="200">
    <img height="10" src="/images/signalfx_orgid.png" />
</Frame>


After we have all what we need, go to Keep and install the SignalFx provider:

<Frame
    width="100"
    height="200">
    <img height="10" src="/images/signalfx_keep.png" />
</Frame>


### Pull
With this approach, Keep will pull alerts from SignalFx every time you refresh the console page.
